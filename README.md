Code Refactoring </br></br>

by Gabrielle Donald<br/> <br/>
For this challenge, I refactored the base code that was provided to me. Both HTML and CSS are the coding languages that were used for this website. I condensed classes in the CSS to make it more streamlined, and I also condensed much of the HTML. Easier to read and more efficient, this code will be easier for future developers to read and work on. I also added some comments throughout the documents to explain the way the code works. Though the code was refactored, the website stayed looking the same. <br/> </br>
